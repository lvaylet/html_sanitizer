<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The first step to start the software and open the existing training
    project "<span style="font-weight: bold;">DI_BASIC</span>".</p>

<h2>Run</h2>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li>
        <p>Note that there are different executable files for different
            combinations of operating system and CPU. When you are running
            Talend Software at work or home, choose the appropriate file
            for your environment. For this training environment the "<b>Talend Data Fabric</b>" is installed.
            Some screenshots may
            show further Platform installations like Data Services.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>For the training double-click the following icon on
            your desktop:<br/><img src="../../Resources/Images/image351.PNG" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>From this window, you choose project to be opened, here
            the training project </p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">DI_B

    </li>
</ol>
<h2>TalendForge</h2>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li>
        <p>Talend Studio or Talend Platform may open with the Welcome
            page displayed:<br/></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>From this window you can read the latest company news
            and access other Talend locations from within Talend Studio
            or Platform. Click "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Start
			 now!</span>":</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Note: that a
    browser tab also opens to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Resources</span>
    page of the Talend Web site. This page provides access to many
    online resources you can use to learn more about Talend products.
    For now, just close the tab.</p>

<h2>Start</h2>

<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li>The Main window appears. The main window of Talend Studio is the interface from which you manage different types
        of data integration, master data management, and profiling processes. The Talend Studio multi-panel window
        contains:
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a menu bar</li>
            <li> toolbar</li>
            <li>a tree view area</li>
            <li>a workspace</li>
            <li>a Palette</li>
            <li>various configuration views organized using a tab system, for any of the elements in the data
                integration Job designed in the workspace
            </li>
            <li>the Outline view and Code Viewer</li>
            <li>a detailed view</li>
            <li>a tab panel (specific to the Column Analysis editors)</li>
            <li>a cheat sheet view</li>
            <li>The figure below shows an example of a Talend Studio main window, open on the Integration perspective,
                and its panels and views.

    </li>

        Get a short overview of the main screen. On the left in the Repository tree you find several nodes. <b>Business
        Models</b>.Talend's Business Models allow data integration project stakeholders to graphically represent their
        needs regardless of the technical implementation requirements. Business Models help the IT operation staff
        understand these expressed needs and translate them into technical processes (Jobs). They typically include both
        the systems and processes already operating in the enterprise, as well as the ones that will be needed in the
        future. A Business Model is a non technical view of a business workflow need. <p><img
            src="../../Resources/Images/repository_business.PNG"/></p></li>
    <li>The folder <b>Job Designs</b> contains all your developed Jobs, which also can be organized in folders. A Job
        Design is the runnable layer of a business model. It is a graphical design, of one or more components connected
        together, that allows you to set up and run dataflow management processes. A Job Design translates business
        needs into code, routines and programs, in other words it technically implements your data flow.
        <p>The Jobs you design can address all of the different sources and targets that you need for data integration
            and data service processes and any other related process:</p>

        <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/repository_JobDesigns.PNG"/></p></li>
    <li>The <b>Contexts</b> folder groups files holding the contextual variables that you want to reuse in various Jobs,
        such as filepaths or DB connection details.. Talend Studio offers you the possibility to create multiple context
        data sets. Furthermore you can either create context data sets on a one-shot basis from the context tab of a
        Job, or you can centralize the context data sets in the Contexts node of the Repository tree view in order to
        reuse them in different Jobs. You can define the values of your context variables when creating them, or load
        your context parameters dynamically.
    </li>
    <p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/repository_Contexts.PNG"/>
    </p>
    <li>The Metadata folder in the Repository tree view stores reusable information on files, databases, and/or systems
        that you need to create your Jobs. Various corresponding wizards help you store these pieces of information that
        can be used later to set the connection parameters of the relevant input or output components and the data
        description called "schemas" in a centralized manner in Talend Studio. The procedures of different wizards
        slightly differ depending on the type of connection chosen.

    <p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/repository_Metadata.PNG"/>
    </p>
    <li>
        <p>The <b>Documentation</b> folder gathers all types of documents, of any format. This could be, for example,
            specification documents or a description of technical format of a file. Double-click to open the document in
            the relevant application.</p>

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>In the Talend Studio's design workspace, both Business Models and Job Designs can be laid out. For both
            Business Models and Job Designs: active designs display in a easily accessible tab system above this
            workspace.</p>

        <p>For Job Designs only. Under this workspace, you can access several other tabs:</p>

        <p>the Designer tab. It opens by default when creating a Job. It displays the Job in a graphical mode.</p>

        <p>the Code tab. It enables you to visualize the code and highlights the possible language errors. The Jobscript
            enables you to visualize and edit the Jobscript.</p>

        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/repository_workspace.PNG"/>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The <b>configuration tabs</b> are located in the lower half of the design workspace. Each tab opens a view
            that displays the properties of the selected element in the design workspace. These properties can be edited
            to change or set the parameters related to a particular component or to the Job as a whole. The
            <b>Component</b>, <b>Run Jobs</b>, <b>Problems</b> and <b>Error Log</b> views gather all information
            relative to the graphical elements selected in the design workspace or the actual execution of the open Job.
        </p>

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>From the <b>Palette</b>, depending on whether you are designing a Job or modeling a Business Model, you can
            drop technical components or shapes, branches and notes to the design workspace for Job design or business
            modeling.</p>

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>At the top of the Talend Studio main window, various menus and a quick access toolbar gather commonly-used
        Talend features.
